				<br><br><p>7.2. Generally, you will engage us to provide the Media Buying Services for an agreed period of time. </p>
				<br><br><p>7.3. As part of setting the media spend budget, we will agree with you the percentage of that spend that will be our Fee for providing the Media Buying Services. Our Fees are due monthly, payable in arrears. </p>
